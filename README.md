# SunBear

A changelog is available in the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/inscreen/sunbear/releases).

Currently only supports Postgres, and TypeORM with Postgres. Additional SQL databases and ORMs are planned.

Documentation and examples will be added as the library matures.

**Warning**: Generally in Postgres, avoid table and column names with uppercase letters. There are workarounds, none are implemented in this library at this time.
